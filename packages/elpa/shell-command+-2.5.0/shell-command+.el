;;; Commentary:

;; `shell-command+' is a `shell-command' substitute, that extends the
;; regular Emacs command with several features.  After installed,
;; configure the package as follows:
;;
;;	(global-set-key (kbd "M-!") #'shell-command+)
;;
;; A few examples of what `shell-command+' can do:
;;
;; * Count all lines in a buffer, and display the result in the
;;   minibuffer:
;;
;;   > wc -l
;;
;; * Replace the current region (or buffer in no region is selected)
;;   with a directory listing of the parent directory.
;;
;;   .. < ls -l
;;
;; * Delete all instances of the charachters a, b, c, ..., z, in the
;;   selected region (or buffer, if no region was selected).
;;
;;   | tr -d a-z
;;
;; * Open a man-page using Emacs default man page viewer.
;;   `shell-command+' can be extended to use custom Elisp handlers via
;;   as specified in `shell-command+-substitute-alist'.
;;
;;   man fprintf
;;
;; See `shell-command+'s docstring for more details on how it's input
;; is interpreted.  See `shell-command+-features' if you want to
;; disable or add new features.
;;
;; `shell-command+' was originally based on the command `bang' by Leah
;; Neukirchen (https://leahneukirchen.org/dotfiles/.emacs).

;;; News:

;;;; Version 2.5.0 (30Sep25)

;; - Fix edge-cases with shell parsing.
;; - Add new command `shell-command+-in-place'.
;; - Remove deprecated option `shell-command+-enable-file-substitution'
;; - Add command substitutions for "clear" and "git".
;; - Move repository from SourceHut to Codeberg.
